Its important to use a license because it dictates how other people can 
use your code. Without one, it'll be restricted to the owner by default. 
A license can also protect you by saying you're not liable if something
goes wrong using your code.

If a project doesn't have a license and you don't have explicit permission
to use that project, then you don't have legal permission to use that project. 
The project owner might also change or add a license that hurts your project,
for example if a company uses code without a license and that code later 
gets licensed at GPL, then the company must also release their code using 
that project under GPL.
