Its important to use a license because it dictates how other people can 
use your code. Without one, it'll be restricted to the owner by default. 
A license can also protect you by saying you're not liable if something
goes wrong using your code. Most importantly, a license tells other how
your code can be distributed.

If a project doesn't have a license and you don't have explicit permission
to use that project, then you don't have legal permission to use that project. 
The project owner might also change or add a license that hurts your project,
for example if a company uses code without a license and that code later 
gets licensed at GPL, then the company must also release their code using 
that project under GPL.

I agree with the claim, from the article it seemed that Gopher could not keep
up with the community and tried to remain closed so it could be licensed  
and used commercially. I think the most important reason it failed was that
it did not accept international standards and did not participate in standards
tracks. This would make it far harder for developers to support Gopher then
the Web, for example anyone could make a web browser if the standards of the
web protocol are open for anyone to study.

Android was created in 2007 as an ambitious operating system to power thousands of different phone models [1](https://www.androidauthority.com/history-android-os-name-789433/). From this Android was created to be adopted by different phone manufacturers. Android adopts the philosophy that they "encourage everyone to make open and modifiable devices but don't think its our place to do so"[2](https://source.android.com/setup/start/licenses). From this Androids goals are adoption and freedoms which match its license.
