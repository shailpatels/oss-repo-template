## Documentation

I'd like to continue working on OpenBooks, which is an open source project 
that was started at the last HackRPI. Its goal is to provide an alternative to 
traditional textbooks by giving a simple to use compiler and syntax to build
more interactive and collaborative webpages that act as textbooks. 

The compiler is written in Python3 and the syntax is still being designed for 
the most part. Some basic features are header and paragraph tags like markdown
and adding images. There is also an option for embedding latex. A long term
future goal I'd like to have is a website for displaying these books, something
similar to dockerhub or github
