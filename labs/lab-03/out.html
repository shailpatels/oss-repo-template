<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>I'd like to continue working on OpenBooks, which is an open source project that was started at the last HackRPI. Its goal is to provide an alternative to traditional textbooks by giving a simple to use compiler and syntax to build more interactive and collaborative webpages that act as textbooks.</p>
<p>The compiler is written in Python3 and the syntax is still being designed for the most part. Some basic features are header and paragraph tags like markdown and adding images. There is also an option for embedding latex. A long term future goal I'd like to have is a website for displaying these books, something similar to dockerhub or github</p>
